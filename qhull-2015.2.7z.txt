This is a backup of the QHull library, compiled using Qt Creator. Win32 Release.
QHull.cpp/h were edited to have additional functions to enable easier use of QHull with vectors and float3 data types.
The static_r and cpp libraries are used in the Reconstruction GUI. The Qt version of the GUI was having linking issues
due to userfrintf being Defined in multiple libraries. Alleviated the problem by not including the printf.c file in the
static_r library.
